## The Sprout Build Script

### Getting Started
1. Make sure you have **Phing** installed or can run it from the **command line**, you may use the provided **phing.phar**
2. Run a `find/replace` on the **build.xml** to update plugin related properties
3. Make sure to update **css.txt**, **js.txt** and **use.json** to your plugin needs.

### Minification & Concatenation
We use the **YUI2** compressor to achieve this and can be found in the **minify** and **concatenate** targets.

### Build & Release
The **build** target runs all the necessary targets and prepares files for **release**.
The **release** target itself archives all the built files and use exclusion to only include production ready code.

### The Special (use) Target
The **use** target takes the **distro** zip created by the **release** target and unzips in into predetermine locations.
You can add as many _absolute_ `/mypath/to/plugins/` or _relative_ `../../plugins` paths to the **use.json** file provided.
