/**
 * CAROUSEL
 *
 * CAROUSEL uses Slick to create a carousel. It defaults to a rather
 * basic, one-slide-at-a-time implementation with dots, but slick supports a
 * good deal of configuration including showing multiple slides, breakpoints,
 * syncing between slides, and plenty of javascript events and methods for
 * integration.
 *
 * The implementation on Boilerplate is using a CDN to provide
 *
 * + slick.css
 * + slick-theme.css
 * + slick.min.js
 *
 * See http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ for more information.
 *
 * The carousel() mixin should be included on a parent element that contains
 * one div per slide. No additional classes are necessary – the slick classes
 * referenced are added dynamically by slick.
 *
 * <div class="carousel">
 *     <div>
 *         <h2>A slide!</h2>
 *         <p>Some text.</p>
 *     </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * Emmet: .carousel>div*3>h2+p
 *
 * While there's more information in slick's documentation, .slick-slide wraps
 * slides while .slick-next and .slick-prev are used for the next/previous
 * arrows.

 * that are only visible while displayed as columns.
