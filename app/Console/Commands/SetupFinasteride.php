While Finasteride starts to work immediately to stop hair loss and regrow hair, it does take 3 months before individuals begin to notice the effects, and continued use prevents further hair loss, and works to regrow hair.</p><p>Finasteride only works when taken on a daily basis.</p><p>Most patients tolerate finasteride very well, and finasteride is an FDA-approved medication. All medications can cause side effects, however, and patients should be aware of possible side effects from using finasteride. In clinical trials, approximately 1.3% of men who used finasteride experienced erectile dysfunction, compared to 0.7% of men who took a non-therapeutic placebo. Decreased libido was reported by 1.8% of men who took finasteride and 1.3% percent of men who were given a non-therapeutic placebo. 0.8% of men who used finasteride in clinical trials reported a lower semen volume. In comparison, 0.4% of men who used a placebo pill reported lower semen volume.</p><p>Finasteride may also cause other, less common side effects. These include depression, pain in the testicles, changes in the breasts (for example, male breast growth, lumps, pain or discharge from the nipples), itching, rash, hives, facial swelling and difficulty breathing or swallowing.</p><p>If you are experiencing any of these side effects you should immediately stop this medication and contact me. If you experience any rash, with facial swelling or difficulty breathing or swallowing, you must seek immediate medical attention, as they can indicate a severe allergic reaction that may be life threatening.</p><p>This medication should not be handled by women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant.</p><p>If you have any questions now or in the future, please do not hesitate to send me a message through your patient portal at CosmeticRx (all information is always HIPAA-encrypted and secure).</p>';
